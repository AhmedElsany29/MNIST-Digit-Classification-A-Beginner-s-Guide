## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Building a feedforward neural network with dense layers and dropout regularization
- Model training, evaluation, and visualization of results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)


## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the notebook (`mnist_classification.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to train and evaluate the model.

## Libraries Used

- `tensorflow` - for building and training the neural network
- `numpy` - for numerical operations and data manipulation
- `matplotlib` - for plotting and visualizing data and results
